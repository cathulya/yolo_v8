Yolo_v8_for_detection
The goal is to check how well YOLO-based methods can accurately and quickly detect objects. To do this, using datasets that are available to the public. Trying out different YOLO versions, like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Train these YOLO models with the datasets and then see how they do using certain measurements, like precision, recall, and mAP. These measurements help us understand how effective the models are at detecting objects.
